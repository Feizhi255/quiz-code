# quiz-code

Take a little quiz on HTML see how u can do. Max score out of a 4. Here are the question in the application: Hyper Text Markup Language Stand For? Which language is used for styling web pages? Which is not a JavaScript Framework? Which is used for Connect To Database?

## What I learned
JavaScript is still hard. Getting to a working state this time was a little harder compared to my password generator. The loop needed to go to the next question was the worst.
